===
My studies + implementations of various data structures.
===

To begin, I will code several DS's in Ruby.<br>
**EDIT** I will also include respective RSpec files for ease of testing.<br>

## Content
(There is no order)<br>

- [ ] Array
  - [x] Static Array
  - [ ] Dynamic Array
- [x] Hash
  - [x] HashSets
- [ ] Linked Lists
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
  - [ ] Min/max queue built using min/max stacks
- [ ] Trees

## Testing

**To run the RSpecs**:<br>
1) Fork/this repo <br>
2) Run `bundle install` in the project directory <br>
3) In the directory (and outside of `lib` and `spec`), run `rspec spec/{file_name}_spec.rb`<br>
4) Enjoy the greenery.<br>




Ideally, I eventually want to double-down and alternatively write them in C.<br>
