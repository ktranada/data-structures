My studies + implementations of various data structures.

To begin, I will code several DS's in Ruby.<br>

Ideally, I eventually want to double-down and alternatively write them in C.<br>

(There is no order.)<br>

- [ ]Array
- [ ] Hashing
  - [x] HashSets
  - [ ] HashMaps
- [ ] Linked Lists
- [ ]Stacks
- [ ] Queues
  - [ ]Min/max queue built using min/max stacks
- [ ] Trees
