===
My studies + implementations of various data structures.
===

To begin, I will code several DS's in Ruby.<br>
**EDIT** I've included RSpec files for ease of testing.<br>

## Content
(There is no order)<br>

Data Structures
- [x] Array
  - [x] Static Array
  - [x] Dynamic Array
- [ ] Linked Lists
  - [ ] Single Linked List
  - [x] Doubly Linked List
- [ ] HashMap
- [ ] Trees
  - [ ] BST

ADT
- [x] HashSet
- [x] MaxStack
- [x] MinMax Stack
  - Built on Arrays
- [x] MinMax StackQueue
  - MinMax Queue built using MinMax Stacks

**Notes**

`HashMap VS HashSet`

A `HashMap` is an implementation of a `Map`, where keys are mapped to a values.

A `HashSet` is an implementation of `Set`, where each element is unique value.

## Testing

**To run the RSpecs**:<br>
1) Fork/this repo <br>
2) Run `bundle install` in the project directory <br>
3) In the directory (and outside of `lib` and `spec`), run `rspec spec/{file_name}_spec.rb`<br>
4) Enjoy the greenery.<br>




Ideally, I eventually want to double-down and alternatively write them in C.<br>
